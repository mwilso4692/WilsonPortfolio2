<!--Accessibility considerations
Opening links in a new tab or window can cause accessibility issues. Here are some reasons why: Links opening in a new tab can prove disorienting for people with low vision or are navigating via screen reader, especially when there is no warning. However, using iframe to package content within a modal also raises accessibility concerns-->

        <p>This is my Design Fuego assignment, the first assignment of the course. I gave an introduction to my design background as a bioengineering student at Pitt. I also gave examples of things I think are good design, like album covers and architecture. This was my first time using VS Code and html.</p>

        <p>These are my 3 logos that I created with Adobe and Canva using AI logo generators. I used my name and "bioengineering"  as the text for each of the logos and a green color scheme. I also used Adobe InDesign to make this layout.</p>

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>I have used a variety of different technologies already in this course, including html, Canva, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Illustrator. I have used each of these programs in conjunction with thoughtful rhetoric to create good designs. The projects encompassed in the "Design Beginnings" portion of this portfolio just gave me a glimpse into possibilities the programs. Design and making is all about thoughtfully using rhetoric and technology together to create an effective design.</p>

            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>In the readings from "The Non Designers Design Book," I have learned a lot about the core principles of design. The core principles are proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast. I have had to learn how to leverage these principles in my designs, especially in the logos and the good design project. In the logos,  had to carefully consider alignment, contrast, and color. In the good design project, I had to identify the usage of these principles in another design while using the principles myself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>In the workshops, I was able to receive feedback from fellow students, which was helpful because my project were never perfect on the first try. I also took inspiration from the work of others because everyone is creative in their own way.</p>

              <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
              <p>None of my project were perfect upon submission and at workshop. It was nice to get perspective from others on how to improve. Often during workshops, I got ideas of how to improve my project, and I made edits to my work. Especially for the A/B/C logos assignment, I saw in workshop the super creative and fun logos that other people had, so I left workshop and redid all of my logos and learned the full capabilities of Adobe and Canva.</p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p>We had to semi-formally present our work for Design Fuego and UX Logo Study, and we casually presented our work to our tables for the rest of the assignments. The casual presentations were nice, low-stakes way to practice articulating how you created your design, and they helped prepare me for more formal presentations. They also helped me with later technical writing, like for the Good Design project where we had to explain different features of good design.</p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>In this section of the course, I have gotten very familiar with Adobe InDesign. The projects encompassed in the "Short Form" portion of this portfolio use more advanced and technical techniques in InDesign, as well as more thoughtgul rhetoric. Specifically, for the infographic, I had to carefully uses graphics and words together to explain a concept effectively. Also, for the accessible design project, I had to think about how to use technology in a new way that is accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p>In this section of the course, we focused primarily on fonts and technical writing and how they integrate into digital design. The advertisement was a good example of this, where the slogans and test used had to draw attention to the product and the fonts and graphics had to further support the messages in the text. It took careful creativity to leverage the design principles in this project. Also, in the accessible design project, I had to leverage the design principles while keeping the design accessible, which was a challenging but worthwhile task. Design principles, like contrast and alignment, were even more important in this project.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p>In the workshops, I was able to receive feedback from fellow students. Specifically, with my infographic, I thought it was helpful to get feedback from people who were not familiar with the topic to ensure I was effectively communicating the concepts. Also for the advertisement, I got to get feedback about my ad to see if it was effective to catch viewers attention and to determine what should change.</p>

               <p>In the workshops, I got feedback on how to improve my work. I remember for the infographic, I received critiques on the font choice, so I changed it to something that was more fitting and less distracting. Also, the two-page spread copy I struggled with using the font-finders, so it was helpful to talk to my peers to learn a better way to match the fonts.</p>
